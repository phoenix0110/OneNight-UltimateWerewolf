# OneNight-UltimateWerewolf UI/UX Redesign Spec

## 1. Objective

This document is the single source of truth for redesigning the UI/UX of `OneNight-UltimateWerewolf`.

Goals:
1. Establish a unified visual and interaction system.
2. Redesign pages with clearer hierarchy and stronger usability.
3. Introduce the **Star-Office-UI** design philosophy: pixel scene + state mapping + spatial storytelling.
4. Keep rollout pragmatic: **the first scene-mapping implementation should focus only on the Day discussion phase**.
5. Make this document usable by another AI / engineer for actual code modification page by page.

This spec is intentionally concrete. It should be followed, not treated as inspiration only.

---

## 2. Product Diagnosis

Current problems in the repo are not about missing features. They are about poor structure and weak experience.

### 2.1 Main UI/UX Problems

1. **Information hierarchy is too weak**
   - Titles, helper text, controls, and status feedback are all visually too close.
   - The user cannot quickly answer: what phase am I in, what should I do now, what matters most.

2. **The app feels like a configuration panel, not a game world**
   - Setup, settings, and gameplay screens are structurally similar.
   - The current UI does not create enough phase contrast.

3. **The pixel style is superficial, not systemic**
   - Emoji and small pixel text are doing too much heavy lifting.
   - There is no coherent scene language tying all phases together.

4. **Day discussion UX is the weakest critical path**
   - Speaking order, chat log, quick speech, input, AI thinking, and phase controls compete for attention.
   - The player’s mental model is not properly guided.

5. **Mobile readability is too weak**
   - Too much 8px/9px text.
   - Tap targets and spacing are often too tight.
   - Critical actions do not stand out enough.

---

## 3. Design Principle

### 3.1 Core Experience Direction

This game should feel like:

**a pixel-night party game with spatial tension and phase-driven atmosphere**

It should NOT feel like:
- a retro-looking admin dashboard
- a settings-heavy AI toy
- a form-first webpage with pixel decoration

### 3.2 Design Philosophy to Borrow from Star-Office-UI

Borrow this idea, not the office theme itself:

> **State changes should be reflected as scene changes.**

Star-Office-UI works because:
- the world is spatial
- status is visible in the environment
- the user reads both the interface and the scene

For One Night Ultimate Werewolf, this means:
- every phase should feel like a different place/state of the village
- UI overlays should sit on top of a scene, not replace the scene
- emotional tone should change with phase progression

### 3.3 Phased Rollout Rule

Do not attempt full scene mapping for all screens in v1.

**Phase-1 requirement:**
- Apply Star-Office-UI-inspired scene mapping only to the **Day discussion phase** first.
- Other screens should adopt improved hierarchy, layout, and visual consistency, but do not need fully developed scene systems yet.

Reason:
- Day discussion is the highest UX pain point.
- It is also the screen that benefits most from spatial storytelling.
- It is the best low-risk place to validate the scene-overlay model.

## 4.3 Typography

### Rule
- Pixel font is for titles, labels, phase headers, and key buttons.
- Body copy should prioritize readability.
- Do not use tiny pixel text for important gameplay information.

### Size scale
- Page title: 24-28
- Section title: 18-22
- Card title: 14-16
- Body: 13-15
- Secondary: 11-13
- Meta/helper: 10-12

## 4.4 Spacing

- `xs = 4`
- `sm = 8`
- `md = 12`
- `lg = 16`
- `xl = 24`
- `xxl = 32`

### Minimum rules
- Primary actions must be at least 44px high.
- Clickable avatars/cards must be at least 44x44.
- Section spacing must never collapse below 16.

## 4.5 Interaction Rules

1. Each screen must have **one dominant task**.
2. Each phase must have **one dominant CTA**.
3. Current phase and current actor must be obvious within 1 second.
4. Selection state must be visibly stronger than hover state.
5. Disabled state must not rely on opacity alone.
6. Empty/loading/error states must be intentionally designed.

---

## 5. Information Architecture Refactor

## 5.1 Target Structure

All gameplay screens should be structured as:

1. **Scene layer**
2. **Phase header layer**
3. **Primary interaction layer**
4. **Secondary info/support layer**
5. **Action footer layer**

Do not keep the current “single column stack of everything” pattern where it causes confusion.

## 5.2 Gameplay Flow Model

Target user mental flow:

1. **Start / understand fantasy** → landing
2. **Configure the match** → setup
3. **Receive role and enter the world** → role reveal
4. **Act at night** → secret action
5. **Debate in day scene** → social deduction core
6. **Make final vote** → tension peak
7. **Understand why the result happened** → resolution

Every screen must support this mental progression.

---

## 6. Scene Mapping Strategy

## 6.1 Long-Term Scene Map

| Phase | Scene idea | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Landing | Village outside / moonlit intro | establish tone |
| Setup | Tavern preparation table | configure match |
| Role reveal | Candlelit card table | ritual reveal |
| Night | Moonlit secret action scene | hidden information |
| Day | Village square discussion | social deduction |
| Vote | Judgment circle / center spotlight | tension peak |
| Result | Dawn reveal | resolution + recap |

## 6.2 Phase-1 Implementation Scope

**Only Day phase must implement full scene-mapping in the first pass.**

This means:
- Create a proper pixel village square discussion scene.
- Place players spatially around a central discussion area.
- Overlay chat / turn status / controls on top of the scene.
- Preserve readability and gameplay clarity.

All other pages should only be redesigned for:
- layout
- hierarchy
- consistency
- improved visual system

Do not overbuild scene systems across all pages in one pass.

---

# 7.6 Day Phase (Highest Priority)

## Purpose
- This is the core of the game.
- It must become a **village square discussion scene**, not just a chat box with controls.

## Phase-1 Star-Office-UI Integration Scope

This is the one screen where scene-mapping should be implemented now.

### Required design translation from Star-Office-UI
Borrow these patterns:
- spatial scene as primary canvas
- user perceives state through placement
- overlay panels sit on top of the scene
- current active actor has spatial emphasis

### Day Scene Concept
A pixel village square at dawn:
- center = discussion/firepit/gathering spot
- players arranged around the square
- current speaker highlighted with stronger light/frame
- AI thinking visually linked to the speaking avatar
- discussion log shown in a controlled overlay panel

## Target layout

### Layer 1: Scene Background
Components:
- `VillageSquareScene`
- `CampfireOrDiscussionCenter`
- `PlayerPositionNodes`

### Layer 2: Phase HUD
Components:
- `PhaseHeader`
  - phase name
  - round number
  - current speaker name
  - “your turn” vs “AI speaking” state

### Layer 3: Discussion Overlay
Components:
- `DiscussionLogPanel`
- `ThinkingIndicator`
- `SystemMessageStyle`

### Layer 4: Human Input Panel
Components:
- `QuickSpeechDrawer`
- `MessageInput`
- `SendButton`

### Layer 5: Action Footer
Components:
- `NextRoundButton`
- `ProceedToVoteButton`

## Component Tree
- `DayPhaseUI`
  - `DaySceneShell`
    - `VillageSquareBackground`
    - `PlayerDiscussionPositions`
      - `DiscussionAvatarNode[]`
  - `PhaseHUD`
  - `SpeakingOrderStrip`
  - `DiscussionLogPanel`
    - `DiscussionMessage[]`
    - `AITypingState`
  - `QuickSpeechDrawer`
  - `HumanInputBar`
  - `DiscussionActionFooter`

## Wireframe behavior

### Current speaker treatment
- Current speaker node is highlighted in the scene.
- Current speaker also appears in HUD.
- If AI is thinking, the thinking state should visually attach to that actor.

### Speaking order strip
- Keep it as a supporting layer, not the visual center.
- It should help orientation, not dominate the page.

### Chat log
- Styled like a discussion record board, not a customer support message box.
- Separate message types clearly:
  - human player
  - AI player
  - system note
  - AI thinking

### Input area
- Must only dominate when it is the human’s turn.
- Quick speech should feel like tactical presets, not a random popup.

## Mandatory constraints
- Do not lose clarity while adding scene flavor.
- Gameplay readability is more important than scene decoration.
- The scene must support state, not distract from it.

## File-level target
- `src/components/game/DayPhaseUI.tsx`
- potentially `src/components/game/PlayerAvatar.tsx`
- potentially new supporting scene component(s), e.g. `src/components/game/DaySceneFrame.tsx`

- `VoteLockedState`

## Wireframe notes
- Candidates should be visually larger and more dramatic.
- The selected target must feel “locked in”.
- Waiting state should indicate collective resolution, not just blinking.

## File-level target
- `src/components/game/VotePhaseUI.tsx`

---

# 7.8 Result Screen

## Purpose
- Let the player understand outcome and cause quickly.
- Make the screen function as both ending and recap.

---

## 11. Acceptance Criteria

A redesign is acceptable only if all of the following are true:

1. A first-time user can tell the current phase within 1 second.
2. A first-time user can tell what action to take next within 2 seconds.
3. Day phase no longer feels like a generic chat panel.
4. The app visually feels like one coherent game system.
5. Day phase clearly reflects Star-Office-UI-inspired spatial storytelling.
6. Setup and results are easier to scan than the current implementation.
7. Mobile readability is significantly improved.

---

## 12. Non-Goals for the First Pass

Do NOT do all of these in the first implementation pass:
- full scene mapping for every page
- full art overhaul for every phase
- heavy animation system across the entire app
- monetization redesign
- major game logic changes

Focus on:
- hierarchy
- clarity
- consistency
- day-phase immersion

---

## 13. Final Instruction for the Implementing AI

When modifying the codebase:
- follow this document as a hard spec
- do not redesign page-by-page in isolation
- preserve a unified visual language across all pages
- prioritize Day phase as the first scene-mapped experience
- do not sacrifice readability for pixel atmosphere
- keep the code change plan incremental and testable
